# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb 

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a rich dataset of Airbnb. The dataset served as the foundation for my analysis, providing a wealth of information to work with.

## Data Collection
Firstly, I collected a rich dataset of Airbnb , which formed the foundation of my analysis. It provided me with a wealth of information to work with.

## Data Exploration
Next, I started exploring the dataset. I loaded it into my analysis tool and carefully examined its structure, data types, and basic statistics. This gave me a good understanding of what I was working with.

## Data Cleaning
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, I performed data cleaning tasks. This involved addressing missing values, removing any duplicate entries, and fixing any inconsistencies in the dataset. By doing this, I made sure that the data I was working with was of high quality.

## Basic Statistics
Once the data was cleaned, I proceeded to calculate and visualize some basic statistics. For example, I determined the average listing price and looked at the distribution of property types. These statistics provided me with a snapshot of the Airbnb landscape and allowed me to gain initial insights into the market.

## Visualization
To bring the data to life, I created captivating visualizations using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations helped me uncover relationships, trends, and preferences hidden within the data. It was fascinating to see the patterns and connections emerge through the visual representations.

## Correlation Analysis
In order to dig deeper, I conducted correlation analysis. This involved exploring the relationships between different features. For instance, I examined how the number of bedrooms affected pricing or how customer reviews influenced booking rates. This analysis helped me understand the interplay between various factors and their impact on Airbnb listings.

Overall, this project was an exciting journey of exploration and analysis. By collecting, exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing the Airbnb data, I gained valuable insights into the market. It was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of the Airbnb landscape and the factors that influence it.

# Project Title: Predicting House Prices

## Project Description
A simple machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and more.

## Steps

1. Data Exploration
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure
   - Check for missing values
   - Gain insights into the distribution of house prices and features

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding for neighborhoods)

3. Feature Selection
   - Choose relevant features that may impact house prices

4. Model Selection
   - Select the most suitable algorithm using cross-validation technique

5. Data Split
   - Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set

6. Model Training
   - Train the chosen regression model on the training data
   - Use the selected features as input and house prices as the target variable

7. Model Ensemble
   - Ensemble the highest two algorithms in R2-score using voting regressor

8. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like R2-score

9. Prediction
   - Use the trained model to make house price predictions for new data points or hypothetical scenarios

10. Model Tuning
    - Experiment with different hyperparameters of the regression model to improve its predictive accuracy
